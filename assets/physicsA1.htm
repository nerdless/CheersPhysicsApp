                <h1>The bubbles in your pint of stout are both falling and rising.</h1>
                <p>It might be hard to believe your eyes, but the bubbles in your pint of stout really are falling. But everyone knows that bubbles rise, so what is going on?</p>
                <p>As your pint of stout settles, a circulating current is set up.  Bubbles in the centre of the glass rise, causing liquid at the sides of the glass to sink, dragging the bubbles with them.</p>
                <p>This can happen in all fizzy liquids, but it’s particularly noticeable in a pint of stout, such as Guinness, because of the colour of the liquid and the small bubbles that are easily moved by the current.</p>

                <p>Try dropping a handful of peanuts in your stout. The nuts will slowly float to the top and fall back down again. Gas bubbles form on the peanuts, making them float upwards. When they reach the top the bubbles burst and the peanuts fall back down again. This experiment may take a while to get going – best use that anonymous pint someone has left on the side! (If by any chance your pub has raisins, use them instead!)</p>
