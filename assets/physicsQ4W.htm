                    The bumps are there so your bottle has the right amount of friction on the conveyer belt during the production process.  Friction is the force that resists the motion of surfaces sliding against each other and depends mainly on the amount of contact between the two surfaces.

                <p>
                    Fewer bumps means less friction and bottles will slide on the conveyer belt in the production process.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But too many bumps means too much friction â€“ which can be a problem when you want to stop the bottles at a barrier, but the belt has to keep on running. The bottles would stick to the belt but the barrier would topple them over. No one likes a spilt beer.

                <p>Place an empty beer bottle on a flat surface, such as a table mat. Lift the surface up on one side until the bottle starts to slide down the mat. At this point the amount of gravity is greater than the friction between the mat and the bottle. Now try with different beer bottles filled with different amounts of beer.</p>
